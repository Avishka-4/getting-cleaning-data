List of the original data sets inside the downloaded zip file:

 	 - 'README.txt': describes about the general information and background related to the data sets within the zip file.
	
 	 - 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

   	 - 'features.txt': List of all features.

   	 - 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

   	 - 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

   	 - 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

   	 - 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

   	 - 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
   
    	 - 'train/subject_train.txt':   Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.
            Its range is from 1 to 30. (for training set)
   
  	 - 'test/subject_test.txt':  Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.
  	    Its range is from 1 to 30. (for test set)
      
   	  The following data sets are not been used in the current project. 

   	 - 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt'; 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt';
   	   'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt'. More information related to these three data sets can be
   	    found in 'README.txt', 'feature_info.txt' and 'feature.txt' and the original website.

There are 5 main steps in run_analysis.R to process the raw data sets and create the tidy data set.
R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3.ses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
